# Architectural Decision Records

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
this document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

This directory is intended to facilitate easy navigation and access
of the architectural decisions taken for this project. The
ADR:s MUST be numbered so they are easily referred to in
documentation and by other ADR:s. ADR:s may refer to requirements.

ADR:s are intended to be immutable. That means after an ADR has
been authored and published, it can only be changed if obsoleted by
another ADR. Upon obsoletion, the current ADR SHOULD be notated
with the identifier of the replacing ADR but no additional change
is allowed. The new ADR MUST provide previous ADR:s that it
obsoletes.

ADR:s SHOULD follow the template given in `TEMPLATE.md` for
consistency but also as assistance in authoring them. An ADR may
stray from the template if being in accordance makes little
sense from the perspective of the ADR.

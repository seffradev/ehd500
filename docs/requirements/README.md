# Requirements

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
this document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

This directory is intended to facilitate easy navigation and access
of the requirements for this project. The requirements MUST be
numbered so they are easily referred to in test cases (for relevant
functional and non-functional requirements), benchmarks (for
relevant non-functional requirements), but also in documentation
and architectural decision records.

Requirements SHOULD follow the template given in `TEMPLATE.md` for
consistency but also as assistance in authoring them. A requirement
may stray from the template if being in accordance makes little
sense from the perspective of the requirement.

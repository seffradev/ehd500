\section*{Preface}

I'd like to thank Leissner Data for the opportunity to implement a
novel technical system where much creativity had to be employed. I
would also like to thank them for the independence and trust to
work in my own way, allowing a thorough attempt at utilizing the
skills taught during the computer engineering program. I'm giving a
specific thanks to Peter FÃ¤ssberg for the depths of knowledge he
provided during the design and discussions of the implementation.

TODO: Thank Hanna, Mikael and possibly others.

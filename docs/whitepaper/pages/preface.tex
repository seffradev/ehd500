\section*{Preface}

I'd like to thank Leissner Data AB for the opportunity to implement
a novel technical system where much creativity had to be employed.
I would also like to thank them for the independence and trust to
work in my own way, allowing a thorough attempt at utilizing the
skills taught during the computer engineering program. I'm giving a
specific thanks to Peter FÃ¤ssberg for the depths of knowledge he
provided during the design and discussions of the implementation.

TODO: Thank Hanna, Mikael and possibly others.

An anecdote to illustrate what this report addresses:
imagine having a mobile phone in China, and another in Spain. Due
to the geographical, political and historical differences, it is
not inconcievable that the mobile networks act differently. In a
smaller scale, the same network operator in two different countries
may support different functionality based on local laws and
agreements with other operators. This means the same mobile device
and SIM may have different behaviors based on location. This paper
proposes (partly) a way to simplify location-dependent service
testing.

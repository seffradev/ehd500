\paragraph{SIM - Subscriber Identity Module} A type of smart card
utilized for the telecommunications sector \cite{sim}. Historically
it was called SIM during the prime of 2G, but a later revision called
Universal SIM (USIM) with 3G \cite{usim} support surfaced. USIM also
enable 4G and 5G support given an appropriate digital profile. While
USIM may be the correct term, SIM will be used in its place, though

SIM is used to provide authentication capabilities by storing
encrypted keys and identification files within a telecommunications
application \cite{sim-application}
